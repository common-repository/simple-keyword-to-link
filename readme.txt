Supported Languages: English and Italian. At the moment.

This is a very basic version of the plugin, where I've filled in as many necessities as I can think of, while trying to keep it as simple and intuitive as possible. If there are any bugs or you want new features, write me at attesor@gmail.com and I will try to update the plugin as soon as possible.
